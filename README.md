## Facial Recognition Project with OpenCV and Flask
## Description: 

I developed a facial recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and Flask. This project aims to detect and recognize faces in real-time through a webcam and provide a web interface for registering new faces into the system.

## Features:
•	Uses OpenCV, a computer vision library, for real-time face detection and recognition.

•	The web application is built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.

•	Allows users to register new faces into the system by entering an associated identification number.

•	Stores face records in local files for further use and analysis.

## Technologies Used:

•	Python

•	OpenCV

•	Flask

•	HTML/CSS (for the web interface)

## Contribution:

•	I developed the project from start to finish, including designing and implementing the facial recognition logic, the web interface, and record storage.

•	Implemented computer vision techniques for face detection and recognition using OpenCV.

•	Designed a simple and user-friendly web interface using Flask for registering new faces.
This project demonstrated my skills in Python programming, web development with Flask, and image processing and computer vision with OpenCV. Additionally, it showcases my ability to develop creative and practical solutions for real-world problems using modern technologies.
